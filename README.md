# CS 280 Computer Vision

Acknowledgement: These assignments are finished in collaboration with Yuting Ye and Jianbo Chen

This repository contains assignments from CS280 at UC Berkeley. Topics include:

## 1. Edge detection
Implemented derivative of Gaussian filter to detect edges. Examples can be found in a jupyter notebook.
## 2. Hybrid images
Implemented Laplacian pyramid to generate hybrid images. Examples can be found in a jupyter notebook.
## 3. Scene category classification w/ ResNet and Tensorflow
Used a modified ResNet with Tensorflow and trained it on a dataset with 100,000 images of 100 different scene categories. Achieved a top 1 error of 48.8%.
## 4. 3D reconstruction
Implemented the 8-point algorithm to reconstruct 3D points from two images with corresponding points.
